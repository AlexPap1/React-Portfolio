      My name is Alex. In May 2020, I graduated from 
      The College of New Jersey with a bachelor's degree in Finance and a minor in Philosophy. 
      I had a career as an accountant for two years, but have since left that career to focus on
      building my coding skills and dedicating myself to my boot camp course full time.

      I have a passion for information technology and am furthering my web development skills. 
      I value continuous learning and one of my goals is to help make information more easily 
      accessible to everyone. I hope to grow professionally and lead a life of impact.
